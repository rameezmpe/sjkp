						<p>BUSINESS/INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION EB-1C</p>

						<p>
							A First Preference Immigration Petition (EB-1) is an employment-based petition for permanent residence. It is broken down into three categories: EB-1A, EB-1B, and EB-1C. EB-1A visas are reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics; EB-1B visas are reserved for individuals who are outstanding professors and researchers; and EB-1C visas are reserved for multi-national executives.
						</p>
						<p>
							EB-1C visas provide an excellent opportunity for foreign, small or midsized businesses to expand into the U.S. market by sending a key executive or manager to run its operations. The decision to move to the United States has long-lasting effects for businesses and families alike. The Attorneys at SJK Partners take the time to understand a client's needs and long-term goals in order to craft an optimal immigration strategy.
						</p>

					<div id="EB-5" class="tab-pane fade">
						<p>
							BUSINESS/INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION EB-5<br>
							<br>
							A Fifth Preference Immigration Petition (EB-5) is an investment-based petition for permanent residence which has two categories: direct and indirect.<br>
							<br>
							The direct EB-5 category requires that a person invest $1,000,000 (or $500,000 if the investment is made in a targeted employment area) in a new commercial enterprise. The enterprise must benefit the United States economy and directly create full-time employment for at least ten United States citizens, green card holders or immigrants holding work visas. A key requirement for the direct EB-5 investment is that the investor must be actively engaged in the new enterprise, meaning he or she cannot merely passively invest in a third party's company.<br>
							<br>
							Alternatively, USCIS has created a Regional Center Program, which services as the indirect EB-5 category. Under this program, a foreign individual may invest $500,000 in a USCIS approved Regional Center as a passive investor in exchange for permanent residence. A key requirement for the indirect investment is that the full investment amount must be at risk for a minimum of 5 years. The investor is generally not involved in the activities of the Regional Center.<br>
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="L-1" class="tab-pane fade">
						<p>
							BUSINESS/INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION L-1<br>
							<br>
							Similar to the EB-1C category, the L-1 visa is a good way for small or midsized foreign business to expand into the U.S. market by sending a key executive, manager, or a key employee with specialized skills, to run its operations. Unlike the EB-1C category, however, the L-1 category provides a temporary, non-immigrant visa. The L-1A category is designed for executive or manager transferees coming to work for the U.S. business. The L-1B category is designed for professional employees with specialized knowledge of the business. One key advantage of the L-1 category is that it allows a company which does not currently have a U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States in order to establish one. Furthermore, it also allows the L-1 visa holder to apply for permanent residence without jeopardizing his or her L-1 visa status.<br>
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="E-2" class="tab-pane fade">
						<p>
							BUSINESS/INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION E-2<br>
							<br>
							The E-2 Treaty Investors category is available to a foreign native of a treaty country who wishes to enter the U.S. solely to develop and direct the operation of an enterprise in which he or she has invested, or is in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital. There are three main requirements to apply for E-2 visas:

							<ol>A treaty must exist between the United States and the foreign country under whose treaty the E status is sought;</ol>
							<ol>Majority ownership or control of the investing or trading company must be held by nationals of the foreign country under whose treaty the E status is sought;</ol>
							<ol>Citizenship of the foreign country under whose treaty the status is sought by each employee or principal of the company who is seeking the E status pursuant to the treaty.</ol>
							Once approved, the applicant is initially allowed a maximum stay of two years; however, extensions may be granted for periods of up to two years each.<br>
